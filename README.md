## Overview

**To do this challenge, you should have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.**

Check the mobile and desktop design in [/design](./design/) folder.

Check [the style-guide](./style-guide.md) for color-theme, typography, icons to be used.

There are no others assets for this challenge, as the country flags will be pulled from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) and you can use an icon font library for the icons.

### The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it similar or as close to the design file.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library and have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

### Requirement

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage.
- Search for a country using an `input` field.
- Filter countries by region.
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page.
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page.
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode.

Your app must be mobile-responsive!

### Local setup

This project is bootstraped using `yarn`.

1. Make sure you have Nodejs installed on your machine.
2. Copy this project locally or download project as ZIP.
3. Open the code-editor of your choice and run `yarn` to start installing project dependencies.
4. Start the project on development server by running `yarn dev`.

If you wish to see the production build before deploying to any hosts, make sure you run `yarn build` and then `yarn start` to run the project in production-mode.

Further, before you deploy always making sure you have run `yarn lint` to ensure your project is following the standard coding-practice.

## Process

### Technical-stacks

- HTML5.
- CSS with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- Typescript.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework.
- [React-Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Icons, but feel free to use FontAwesome or any other icon-libraries.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - Promise-based HTTP Client, but feel free to use `fetch()`.

### Deployment

As this project is built on using NextJS, I decide to use Vercel to host. 

How to deploy NextJS project to Vercel:
1. TBA

Nonetheless, there are many ways to host your project for free, such as:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

Simply choose the platform you are most comfortable and familiar using.

Remember to copy/paste any of your production environment variable into the host platform you are using.
